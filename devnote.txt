==========================+++NOTE+++================================

Compiler and Static Template is not included on redist version of this engine
the reason is to prevent a premature or unbootable as a result of compiling in an incompatible environment

The environment that its required is
- x86_64 machine with linux host (NOT WSL (but you could try WSL2 though))
- Have SuperUser access ( rooted )
- Have Base x86_64 Extracted ( Reason it is removed due to storage saving )
- Static sample
